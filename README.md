A simple 2D pixel delivery game. Mainly based of my OC that I spent 3 years procrastinating on.
Your goal is to deliver mail & packages to different houses before nightfall!
The game is quite bad from a game design standpoint (due to time-constraint).

# How to Run:
- Download all the files from the repository.
- Run the main.py file.

## Game Controls:
M  = Open map

F = Interact with door

Esc = Exit out of dialogue / map
